Hello!
My name is Xiao Lin.

I am from Ningbo, China. Ningbo is a peaceful southern city near Shanghai.

I am a junior studying Statistics and Psychology in UIUC.

My plan after graduation is to go to a graduate school for Psychology, most likely for industrial organizational psychology. In the graduate school, I would try to learn more about workplace issues and search for an opportunity like an internship to contribute myself into the community. With a good Statistics skill, I would also be interested in joining a psychology lab for a few years.
