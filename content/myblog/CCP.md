## CCP Program Mission
In keeping with the Counseling Center mission, the training and and outreach of the Counseling Center Paraprofessional program strives to incorporate a multicultural, developmental, and strenghs-based approach to psychoeducational services offered.

## About the Paraprofessional Program
Counseling Center Paraprofessionals (CCPs) are students from ALL departments on campus and with many different majors. They are students who want to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life while having a good learning experience.

The CCP program provides training in communication and helping skills with practical experience in providing developmental and preventive services to students. In addition to these skills, students gain knowledge in mental health concerns, cultural competence, program planning, practical applications for research, public speaking, organizational leadership, and more. These skills are beneficial for a wide variety of career and graduate school fields, including the helping professions, education, health promotion, community development, human resources, and many more.

The CCP Program provides a great experience; it received the 2013 University of Illinois Student Affairs Outstanding Program Award.
